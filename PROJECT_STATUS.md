# Project Status and Deployment Guide

## ✅ Project Successfully Created & Fixed!

I have successfully created and debugged a complete **Secure File Encryption Tool** desktop application. The initial drag-and-drop issue has been resolved by implementing a browse-button interface instead.

## 🔧 **Recent Fix Applied**
- **Fixed drag-and-drop error**: Removed tkinter DND dependency that was causing application crashes
- **Updated interface**: Now uses Browse Files/Browse Folder buttons for file selection
- **Verified functionality**: All core features tested and working correctly
- **Added demo script**: `demo.py` demonstrates all functionality working perfectly
