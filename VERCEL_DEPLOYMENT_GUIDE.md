# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem
Your Secure File Encryption Tool was originally a Python tkinter desktop application, but you're trying to deploy it to Vercel, which only supports web applications. This causes a 404 NOT_FOUND error.

## Solution
I've created a web version of your application that works with Vercel hosting.

## Steps to Fix the Hosting Issue:

### 1. Deploy the Web Version to Vercel

```bash
# If you haven't installed Vercel CLI yet
npm install -g vercel

# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/securityapplication

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Configure Vercel Project Settings

When prompted by Vercel CLI:
- **Framework Preset**: Select "Other"
- **Build Command**: Leave empty
- **Output Directory**: Leave empty
- **Install Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 3. Alternative: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/LingeshwarKulal/Securetool.git`
3. Configure the project:
   - Framework Preset: "Other"
   - Root Directory: `.` (current directory)
   - Build Settings: Use default

### 4. Environment Variables (if needed)

If you need any environment variables, add them in Vercel dashboard:
- Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add any required variables

## What's Changed

‚úÖ **Added Web Application (`web_app.py`)**
- Flask-based web server
- Same AES-256 encryption as desktop version
- RESTful API endpoints for encrypt/decrypt

‚úÖ **Modern Web Interface (`templates/index.html`)**
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Tab-based navigation (Encrypt/Decrypt)
- Real-time progress indicators
- Modern UI matching your desktop theme

‚úÖ **Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)**
- Proper Python runtime configuration
- Correct routing for Flask application

‚úÖ **API Entry Point (`api/index.py`)**
- Vercel serverless function entry point
- Handles web requests properly

## Testing the Web Application Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Install Flask dependencies
pip install Flask

# Run the web application
python web_app.py

# Open browser to http://localhost:5000
```

## Features of the Web Version

- üîê **Same Security**: Uses identical AES-256 encryption
- üì± **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on phones/tablets
- üé® **Modern UI**: Beautiful interface matching your desktop theme
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Drag & Drop**: Easy file upload with drag-and-drop
- üì• **Auto Download**: Encrypted/decrypted files download automatically
- üîÑ **Real-time Feedback**: Loading indicators and progress updates

## Expected Result After Deployment

After successful deployment, your Vercel URL will show:
- A modern encryption tool interface
- File upload areas for encryption/decryption
- Password input fields
- Encrypt/Decrypt buttons that actually work
- Automatic file downloads for results

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Functions tab
   - Check for any error logs

2. **Verify Dependencies**:
   - Ensure `requirements.txt` includes all Flask dependencies
   - Check that cryptography library installs properly

3. **Test Endpoints**:
   - Try accessing `/` (should show the interface)
   - Test file upload functionality

## Alternative Hosting Options

If Vercel doesn't work well for your needs:

1. **Heroku**: Great for Python web apps
2. **Railway**: Simple Python deployment
3. **PythonAnywhere**: Python-focused hosting
4. **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Scalable option

The web version will work on any of these platforms!

## Benefits of Web Version

- ‚úÖ Accessible from any device with a browser
- ‚úÖ No installation required for users
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility
- ‚úÖ Easy sharing via URL
- ‚úÖ Automatic updates when you deploy changes
- ‚úÖ Same strong encryption as desktop version
