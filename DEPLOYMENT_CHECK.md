# 🎯 Vercel Deployment Status Check

## Current Status: ✅ Latest Code Pushed Successfully

**Latest Commit**: `f74fa94` - Contains all fixes for tkinter-dev error
**Repository**: https://github.com/LingeshwarKulal/Securetool.git

## 📋 Verification Checklist:

### ✅ Fixed Files Confirmed:
- `requirements.txt` - Clean (only cryptography, Flask, Werkzeug)
- `app.py` - Simplified encryption app for Vercel
- `vercel.json` - Proper configuration for serverless deployment
- All fixes pushed to GitHub successfully

### 🚀 Next Steps to Check Deployment:

#### Option 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for "Securetool" project
3. Check "Deployments" tab for new deployment from commit `f74fa94`
4. If you see a new deployment, it should succeed (no more tkinter-dev error)

#### Option 2: GitHub-Vercel Integration
If you connected your GitHub repo to Vercel:
- New deployment should trigger automatically from the push
- Look for Vercel status checks in your GitHub repository
- Check "Actions" tab in GitHub for deployment status

#### Option 3: Import Fresh Project
If the above doesn't work, import as new project:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import from GitHub: `LingeshwarKulal/Securetool`
4. Framework: "Other"
5. Deploy

```

### ✅ New Success (Expected):
```
